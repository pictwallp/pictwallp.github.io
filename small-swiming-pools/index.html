<p>For our small inground vinyl pool kits, we have done small pool sizes of 10’x10′, 8’x24′, and even 12’x18′, but can do nearly any size and shape. If you want a pool that is smaller than 10’ by 20’, our experts at georgia pools suggest that you opt for a concrete inground pool because it can be poured and molded into any size. The costs are generally much lower because the equipment is different and maintenance definitely does not take as long. In my mind, it’s anything that’s under 10,000 gallons or less than 200 sq. Plunge pools perth the perfect small space solution. Nicole has built her own swimming pool.</p>
